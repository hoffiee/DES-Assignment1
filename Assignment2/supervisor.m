function S = supervisor(P,Sp,Sigma_u)
% P = given plant
% Sp = specification
% Sigma_u = set of uncontrollable events 
%
% Use the given to generate a nonblocking 
% and controllable supervisor S
%

% It is assumed that Sigma_Sp is a subset of Sigma_P where
% Sigma_P and Sigma_Sp are the event sets of the plant P 
% and the specification Sp. Supervisor is generated by 
% implementing Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 in the lecture
% notes.
